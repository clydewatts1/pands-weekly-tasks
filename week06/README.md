# Weekly task 6
Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.

I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).

This is to demonstrate that you can research and code a process (If you really needed the square root you would use one of the above methods). I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots. 

This is a more difficult task than some of the others, but will be marked equally, so only do as much work on this as you feel comfortable.
`
$ python squareroot.py
Please enter a positive number: 14.5
The square root of 14.5 is approx. 3.8.
