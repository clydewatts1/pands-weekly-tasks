# Week 03 : Task 03

Bank account numbers can stored as 10 character strings, for security reasons some applications only display the last 4 characters (with the other other characters replaced with Xs).

Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).


python accounts.py
Please enter an 10 digit account number: 1234567890
XXXXXX7890
Extra:
Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length (yes that is a vague requirement, comment your assumptions)
